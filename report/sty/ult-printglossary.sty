% Override \printglossary to prevent blank page from being inserted
% when acronym/glossary list is empty.
%
% The problem is that an "empty" auxiliary file for a glossary list
% will contain "\null" as its file contents. The \null command is the
% same as \hbox{}, and will flush a new page if called after a
% \clearpage or \cleardoublepage, which is *extremely* undesirable.
%
% The following hack exploits the fact that \printglossary uses the
% \@input@ command to output the contents of the auxiliary file for
% the glossary list. So we re-define \@input@ temporarily to use
% LaTeX magic to read the entire file contents into a command
% \ult@read@buf, and test if the file contents are strictly equal to
% \null. If so, we simply ignore the \@input@, else we call the
% normal \@input@ command (that we have saved first). Then, when
% \printglossary calls \@input@, it will actually call our overridden
% command, and make sure we don't output anything if the file only
% contains \null. Finally, we restore the original \@input@ command
% so it can be used later.
%
% Note: Must use \LetLtxMacro because \printglossary is complex with
% default value for parameter.
% See: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=patch
%
% Also note: I tried to use a normal LaTeX \read-loop with scantokens,
% but did not succeed, so I ended up using the 'catchfile' package,
% which seems to get the job done!
